# Java-1 Repository

This repository contains Java test files that demonstrate and test basic operations for several core data structures, including arrays, ArrayLists, HashSets, and LinkedLists.

## Files Overview

- **ArrayListTest.java**: Contains tests for operations on Java's `ArrayList`, including adding, removing, and iterating over elements.
- **ArrayTest.java**: Demonstrates operations on basic arrays, such as accessing and modifying elements.
- **HashSetTest.java**: Tests for the `HashSet` class, focusing on element uniqueness and set operations.
- **LinkedListTest.java**: Tests `LinkedList` functionality, including insertion and traversal.

## Additional Files

- **Big-O Notation Spreadsheet**: A file outlining Big-O complexities for various operations on these data structures.

## Usage

Clone the repository and run each Java file to see examples of how these data structures operate in Java.
